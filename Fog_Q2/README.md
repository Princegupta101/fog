# 🌧️ Rain Pattern Simulation Assessment - FOG

Welcome to the **Rain Pattern Simulation** project! This repository provides a creative solution to simulate a rain pattern effect using react.js JavaScript and HTML canvas. Ideal for exploring fundamental concepts in graphics and animation, this project visualizes rain droplets to create a realistic rain effect, which can be used in web applications or as an interactive visual feature.
